# Intro-to-react

This contains all the ideas i have learnt or learning using ReactJS+Vite located in vite-project.

What i learnt till now-

1. Else if and ternary operator in App.jsx and Contact.jsx
2. Used array mapping to render lists in List.jsx.
3. Used props(object,string, function) in Header.jsx and Aboutjsx.
4. Used form control by managing click events and useRef (changing attributes , retrieving form data, CSS, caching expensive computation and persisted mutable) in Contact.jsx, List.jsx, About.jsx and Image.jsx.
5. Used simple counter in count.jsx using useState.
6. Used usestate immmutable array and object to build to do list in Todo.jsx.
7. Used usestate to manage and update form in Form.jsx
8. Used useEffect to fetch dummy JSON data using promises and async/await in Apicall.jsx.
9. Used routing in app.jsx for showcasing all the things done yet
10. Added hashrouting and query parameters.
