# Intro-to-react

This contains all the ideas i have learnt or learning using ReactJS+Vite located in vite-project.

What i learnt till now-

1. Else if and ternary operator in App.jsx and Contact.jsx
2. Used array mapping to render lists in List.jsx.
3. Used props(object,string) in Header and About.
4. Used form control by managing click events and useRef (changing attributes and retrieving form data) in Contact.jsx and Image.jsx.
